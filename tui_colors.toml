# TUI Color Configuration
# Edit this file to customize chess board colors without rebuilding.
# Colors are specified as RGB values "R, G, B" where each value is 0-255.
# If this file is missing or invalid, default colors will be used.
#
# Design principles:
# - Light squares: Medium-light tone (not too light, so white pieces contrast)
# - Dark squares: Medium-dark tone (not too dark, so black pieces contrast)
# - White pieces: Very light/white (visible on dark squares)
# - Black pieces: Very dark/black (visible on light squares)

# Light squares (medium-light beige - provides contrast for both piece colors)
light_square = 200, 180, 150

# Dark squares (medium-dark brown - provides contrast for both piece colors)
dark_square = 120, 90, 60

# White pieces (very light - clearly visible on dark squares)
piece_white = 255, 255, 255

# Black pieces (very dark - clearly visible on light squares)
piece_black = 30, 30, 30
